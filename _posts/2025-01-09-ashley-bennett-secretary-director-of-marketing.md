We are pleased to announce that earlier this week, **Ashley Bennett** was elected as the **Secretary and Director of Marketing** for the Heartland Transpersonal Alliance. Ashley brings a wealth of experience in marketing, graphic design, and digital outreach. We are confident her contributions will help our team engage and grow effectively, particularly with our primary initiative, the **Psychedelic Society of Kansas City**.

With this change, **Dr. Christine Ziemer** has transitioned to the newly created role of **Executive Director** of the board. In this capacity, she will continue working closely with **Dale Morgan**, our President, to guide all high-level organizational decisions and functions.

This marks an exciting new chapter for the Heartland Transpersonal Alliance as we move forward with expanded capabilities and a commitment to sharing the transformative power of transpersonal experiences.
